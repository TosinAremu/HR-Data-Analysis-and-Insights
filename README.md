# HR Data Analysis And Insights

## Project Title: Comprehensive HR Data Analysis for Enhanced Employee Retention and Engagement

### Project Objective
The goal of this HR data is to analyse employee data to uncover patterns related to attrition, job satisfaction, and other HR metrics. The insights gained can guide organizational strategies to improve employee retention, satisfaction, and overall HR management.

#### Project 1: Attrition Analysis
There are several factors contributing to employee attrition, which are some of the listed below.
1. Pay benefits: Staff who feel they are not paid fairly or that some other company will pay them higher, will lead to them being dissatisfied. This eventually causes them to leave.
2. Role mismanagement: This can happen when the employee perceives their job scope to be ambiguous or disconnected.
3. Workload: If an employee is overloaded with work, it could cause high stress levels, decreased productivity, and potential resignation. Contrastingly, if employees have limited tasks, they feel disengaged from the workplace and would seek opportunities elsewhere.
4. Manager's attitude: Employees might choose to leave if they struggle with their managerâ€™s ineffective leadership or mismanagement style.
