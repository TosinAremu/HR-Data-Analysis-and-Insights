# HR Data Analysis And Insights

## Project Title: Comprehensive HR Data Analysis for Enhanced Employee Retention and Engagement

### Project Objective
The goal of this HR data is to analyse employee data to uncover patterns related to attrition, job satisfaction, and other HR metrics. The insights gained can guide organizational strategies to improve employee retention, satisfaction, and overall HR management.

### Attrition Analysis
There are several factors contributing to employee attrition, which are some of the listed below.
- Pay benefits: Staff who feel they are not paid fairly or that some other company will pay them higher, will lead to them being dissatisfied. This eventually causes them to leave.
- Role mismanagement: This can happen when the employee perceives their job scope to be ambiguous or disconnected.
- Workload: If an employee is overloaded with work, it could cause high stress levels, decreased productivity, and potential resignation. Contrastingly, if employees have limited tasks, they feel disengaged from the workplace and would seek opportunities elsewhere.
-  Manager's Attitude: Employees might choose to leave if they struggle with their manager’s ineffective leadership or mismanagement style.

### Data Sources
The dataset for this analysis was shared on the Incubator hub Learning Management System.

### Tools Used:
The tool used for the analysis are;

- Microsoft Excel 
    1. For Data Cleaning
    2. For Analysis
- Power BI
    1. Data Transformation
    2. Data Cleaning
    3. Data Visualisation

### Data Visualisation
This is presenting the result found using, card, donut chart, pie chart stacked column chart, clustered column chart, table, matrix, and slicer to filter.

#### 1. Overall Attrition Metrics
  - Total Employees: 1,470
  -	Total Attrition Count: 237, representing an attrition rate of 16%.
  - Current Employees: 1,233
  - Average Age: 37 years

A 16% attrition rate indicates that the company experiences moderate employee turnover. This could be a concern if certain departments or roles have higher attrition rates, as they may be experiencing particular challenges or dissatisfaction.

#### 2. Attrition by Department
  - R&D: 133 attritions, which is 56.1% of total attrition.
  - Sales: 92 attritions, 38.8%.
  - HR: 12 attritions, 5.1%.

High attrition in R&D and Sales suggests potential issues in these departments, possibly related to job satisfaction, workload, or compensation. HR has a much lower attrition rate, which might imply more stability or better employee satisfaction in that department.

#### 3. Attrition by Educational Field
  - Attrition numbers across fields show that Life Sciences and Medical have relatively high attrition counts, while Marketing and Technical Dergree fields show moderate numbers.
  - Employees with backgrounds in fields such as Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing may require additional retention strategies, especially if these skills are critical to the company’s success.

#### 4. Attrition by Gender
  - Male: 150 attritions (63.3%).
  - Female: 87 attritions (36.7%).

Males are experiencing a higher rate of attrition compared to females. This could be due to various reasons, such as job role challenges, satisfaction, or potential external opportunities more accessible to males in this specific company context.

#### 5. Attrition by Age Group
  - Under 25: 38 (20 males, 18 females)
  - 25-34: 112 (69 males, 43 females)
  - 35-44: 51 (37 males, 14 females)
  - 45-54: 25 (16 male, 9 females)
  - Over 55: 11 (8 males, 3 females)

The majority of attrition is occurring among employees aged 25-34 and 35-44. Younger employees might be more transient, seeking career growth or new opportunities elsewhere. This high turnover rate in younger age groups might indicate a need for improved onboarding, training, and engagement for new and early-career employees.

#### 6. Job Role and Satisfaction Analysis
  - Employees in Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive roles seem to have the highest attrition.
  - Dissatisfaction rates are relatively high across roles, but especially noticeable for Research Scientist and Sales Executive positions.
  - Job satisfaction levels vary, with a significant number of employees marking “Dissatisfied” and “Satisfied” rather than “Very Satisfied.” This might suggest that improvements in workplace culture, compensation, or work-life balance could help elevate satisfaction levels.

#### 7. Marital Status of Employees
  - The majority of employees are married (589), followed by single (350). Divorced employees are significantly fewer.
  - Marital status could impact employee needs, with married employees potentially valuing stability and work-life balance. Tailoring benefits and policies that address these needs could positively influence retention, especially for employees in departments with high attrition.

#### 8. Educational Field Distribution
  - Employees are distributed across various fields with Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing making up the largest numbers.
  - Employees from Technical Degree and Other fields also represent significant portions, suggesting a diverse educational background in the workforce. This diversity could be a strength, but may also present unique challenges in aligning engagement and retention strategies.

### Key Recommendations:
1. Focus on High-Attrition Departments: Address specific issues in R&D and Sales. Conduct focus groups or interviews to understand concerns and tailor retention strategies accordingly.
2. Enhance Employee Satisfaction: Job roles with high dissatisfaction (e.g., Research Scientist, Sales Executive ) might benefit from improved work-life balance, career development opportunities, and clearer paths for advancement.
3. Retention Strategies for Younger Employees: Implement targeted programs for younger employees to improve retention, such as mentorship, career growth opportunities, and clear pathways to promotion.
4. Gender-Specific Retention Efforts: With higher attrition among males, investigate if certain roles or policies are disproportionately affecting male employees and adjust accordingly.
5. Boosting Satisfaction Across Roles: Since few employees report being “Very Satisfied,” conduct employee engagement surveys and explore initiatives that can improve satisfaction and workplace culture across the board.

This analysis highlights areas of concern and opportunities for targeted HR interventions to improve employee retention and satisfaction across the organization.
